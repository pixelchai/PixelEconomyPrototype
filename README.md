# PixelEconomyPrototype

## What is this?
This repo is a front-end only prototype I quickly made for PixelEconomy using Jekyll, a static site generator.
To generate and serve the static website, `jekyll s` in the root directory of this repo.

Also I implemented the pixel art editor at this stage as well, since that is all done client-side.

I will probably private this repo after the competition finishes because it's just quick hacky prototype code.

For the actual project repo, see https://github.com/pixelzery/PixelEconomy
